## Summary of the project
The project is called "Recidivism Prediction" which is 
predicting which convicts are likely to commit crime again in order to determine rehabilitation strategies.

The source data that was used is Recidivism dataset for prisoners serving prison terms in Iowa over a three year period, after initial release from prison. 
Includes data for race/ethnicity, age, offense type etc. for each prisoner.
In order to tackle the problem of developing a machine learning algorithm to determine which characteristics  (features) of an inmate contribute more to recidivism, the following approach was used:

A Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm with the target variable being 'Return to Prison'.
  - A Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm is used as there is a target variable that can be used to predict the accuracy of the Machine Learning Algorithm.
  - The 'Return to Prison' variable is set as the target as it tells us whether the prisoner returned to prison within 3 years of being out of prison.

Major recidivism is related to Drug trafficking and in between the ages 25 to 34.


## Self assessment
I played a circle role in this project. I was responsible for the ERD design, database creation, data cleaning and then loading the cleaned data as tables into the database which is then used for the machine learning model.

Apart from this role I also participated in all the team discussions relating to the data visualisation part, working on the presentation and also wherever my help is required.

The major personal challenge I faced was in the data cleaning and processing part. When using Pyspark for connecting to the amazon RDS and cleaning the data . For this I had to do a lot of google searching for getting the correct syntax or and trying different ways to achieve my expected result.

## Team assessment
We were a team of four. I didn't have even a small uncomfort working with them. We were very helpful
to each other. We communicated through slack. I felt we could have spent a little more time and decided the project
fast so that we would have more time working on machine learning trying out different features or models.
I want to share with the new cohort that to communicate well within a team , help each other and work together.
